# Resume Website — Xisco Pons

## Project Analysis

### User Profile — User Persona

**Name:** Anna 

**Age:** 32  

**Occupation:** IT Recruiter at a tech company  

**About Anna:**  
The person I've thought about is a recruiter who reviews dozens of CVs daily. She's a person that values websites that are easy to navigate, load quickly, and visually communicate professionalism and attention to detail.  

**Goals:**  
- To quickly find essential information (skills, experience, education).  
- To evaluate the candidate’s technical and design skills through the website’s quality.  
- To access contact details or social links immediately.

### Information Architecture

The website is designed as a **single-page resume** divided into two main areas: a **sidebar** and a **main content area**.

The **sidebar (left side)** I made is just a quick summary of the my identity and key information. It contains the **profile picture**, **name**, **title**, **contact details**, **skills**, **languages**, and **social links**.

The **main content (right side)** just has like professional information into separated **sections** using HTML `<section>` elements. These include:  

- **Education:** Academic background and qualifications, listed chronologically.  
- **Experience:** Work history, responsibilities, and achievements, formatted with bullet points for clarity.  
- **Volunteer Experience:** Highlights of unpaid or community work, demonstrating values and additional experience.  

This is just to structure-mirror how recruiters naturally are supposed to read resumes — starting with identity and contact details (left), then diving into professional experience and education (right).

### Visual Design

The visual design is a clean design inspired by digital resumes. The layout uses a **two-column structure** to get visual stability with content presentation.  

The **color palette** has neutral tones like **white, gray, and black**, with contrast between the sidebar and main content area. This gives the professional look  for a CV while maintaining readability and balance. The sidebar’s slightly darker background helps separate personal details from main content visually.  

The **typography** is simple and legible: larger font sizes for the name and section titles, and smaller text for details.

**Font Awesome icons** are used to add visual cues next to contact details and skills, contributing to a modern and polished look without distracting from the content.  

Ample **white space** and consistent padding give the design a calm, organized appearance. Alignment and spacing are adjusted to create a sense of structure and harmony.
