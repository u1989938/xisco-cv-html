### Information Architecture

The website is designed as a **single-page resume** divided into two main areas: a **sidebar** and a **main content area**.

The **sidebar (left side)** provides a quick summary of the individual’s identity and key information. It contains the **profile picture**, **name**, **title**, **contact details**, **skills**, **languages**, and **social links**.

The **main content (right side)** organizes professional information into clearly separated **sections** using semantic HTML `<section>` elements. These include:  

- **Education:** Academic background and qualifications, listed chronologically.  
- **Experience:** Work history, responsibilities, and achievements, formatted with bullet points for clarity.  
- **Volunteer Experience:** Highlights of unpaid or community work, demonstrating values and additional experience.  

This structure mirrors how recruiters naturally read resumes — starting with identity and contact details (left), then diving into professional experience and education (right).

### Visual Design (≈220 words)

The visual design follows a **clean, modern, and professional** aesthetic inspired by digital resumes. The layout uses a **two-column structure** to balance visual stability with content presentation.  

The **color palette** focuses on neutral tones — mainly **white, gray, and black**, with subtle contrast between the sidebar and main content area. This ensures a professional look suitable for a CV while maintaining readability and balance. The sidebar’s slightly darker background helps separate personal details from main content visually.  

The **typography** is simple and legible: larger font sizes for the name and section titles, and smaller text for details.

**Font Awesome icons** are used to add visual cues next to contact details and skills, contributing to a modern and polished look without distracting from the content.  

Ample **white space** and consistent padding give the design a calm, organized appearance. Alignment and spacing are adjusted to create a sense of structure and harmony.
